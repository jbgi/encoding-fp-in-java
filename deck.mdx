# Encoding FP in Java
is easier than in Go!

![](images/lambdaworld.png)

### `new LambdaWorld<Cadiz>(2018L)`


```notes
Why not go? the bare minimum I need is generics
ie. a lang where system-F formalism more-or-less apply for reasoning about types.

For haskell dev: translate your jargon and knowledge when navigating in 00-land.
For Java dev: demytify FP technics by implementing them in Java.
Actual practical goal: gains more technics for writing working software.

## Thesis of this talk

Typed Functional Programming is
the most pratical way to write
maintainable, working software.

<Appear>
<p>Not gonna argue this.</p>
<p>Typed Functional Programming require at the minimum a type system that can encode System F.</p>
</Appear>

---
## Java is partialy supportive of this thesis
#### Java can encode System F, but, out-of-the-box, is missing:
<ol>
<li>IO effect tracking</li>
<li><a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/≃dreyer/tor/papers/wadler.pdf">Parametricity</a></li>
<li>Native sum types / GADT</li>
<li>Extensibility other than inheritance</li>
<li>Tail call optimization</li>
<li>Support for Lazy evaluation</li>
<li>HKT (aka. type constructor polymorphism, ie. System Fω)</li>
</ol>

```notes
Parametricity (most important property) in Java would means that generic methods behave the same whatever the type arguments.
If your PL does not have generics or equivalent, this talk does not apply.

Native sum types are coming, maybe. but everyone will stay on Java11 for the next ten years.

TCO: not counting on it before long.

HKT: eg. write code that would work for any type that has a map function.
(in Java8: Future, Optional, Stream)
Do you imagine writing something as simple as a mincraft library without
type constructor polymorphism? (DataFixerUpper)

```

## Encoded in this talk

Desired                        | Encoded with
------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------
[X] IO effect tracking         | No side effects + `IO<A>` (from FunctionalJava).
[X] Parametricity              | Ignoring everything that can break it.
[X] sum types / GADT           | `List<A>{ <X> X cases(X nil, F2<A, List<A>, X> cons);}` (Scott encoding).
[X] Expression Problem solution| Object algebras
[X] Lazy evaluation            | `static <A> List<A> lazy(F0<List<A>> as)` (with memoization).
[/] HKT                        | `List<A>` => `Hk<List<?>, A>` (Unsafe).

```notes
TC0: use while loop. But TCO is no magic. when It doesn't: list.reverse.foldLeft or:
Lazy contructructor, via memoization of suspended expression or Trampoline.
HKT: unsafe but required for writing any basic mincraft libray, I mean encoding profunctor optics.
```

## Can break Parametricity

hence, in pure code, we completly ignore the existence of:

 - `null`
 - `instanceOf` / type casts
 - non-deterministic exceptions
 - all methods on `java.lang.Object`

```notes

Parametricity:  in particular, java.lang.Object as no methods,
  no instanceOf or casting (thus excluding making use of reyfied generics in language that have them),
  We never catch exceptions, we never test for nullity.
  Doing so is not programming it is kind of co-programming,
  ie. code that reason about the execution of a program behave
  (checking the program terminate correctly).
  Doing so with IO is OK, as doing IO is co-programming.
```

---
## How to prove an encoding is correct?

1. Hot(t) take: if two types are isormorphic then they are the same.

![Bijection](images/Bijection.png)

2. We ignore bottom values, [including null](https://chris-martin.org/2017/null-as-bottom),
   as per [Fast and Loose Reasoning is Morally Correct](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/fast+loose.pdf).

## Using cardinality to prove isomorphism

Same cardinality ≃ Isormorphic

Type           | Cardinality
-------------- | -------------
`Void`         | 0
`Unit` / `()`  | 1
`Boolean`      | 2
`Either<A, B>` | A + B
`P2<A, B>`     | A * B
`F<A, B>`      | B<sup>A</sup> <Appear>(need A tests)</Appear>

## Yoneda to the rescue

If `f` is a Functor, then:

`(∀ x. (a -> x) -> f x)` ≃ `f a`

Equivalences   | Step
-------------- | -------------
`∀ x. x -> x`  | Introduce unit, `x` ≃ `() -> x`:
`∀ x. (() -> x) -> x`  | Introduce `Id` functor (`Id x = x`):
`∀ x. (() -> x) -> Id x`      | Apply Yoneda:
`Id ()` | `Id x = x`:
`()`     | Q.E.D.

```notes
Alternativeley: case analysis, taking advantage of basic properties of parametric functions:
 1. all generic values in the result must come from the argument.
 2. behavior does not depends on generics arguments

Church encoded ADT are polymorphic functions, and functions are contravariant:
subtyping visitor => new super type! 

Very useful for versionned data types, like events in event-source system, to convert from old to new version.
Override and default method can be use to set default value for new field.

## Limitation of final tagless / object-algebra encoding

Programs are a "monolitic" fold.

Manipulating each part as first-class values (initial algebra) simplify some tasks,
eg. serialization / delegation to GPU.
or just for the simpler API!

Hopefully there is an isomorphism between the two encoding (Lambek’s theorem).

## On the usefulness of lazy evaluation 
aka. call-by-name with sharing.

Allows to implement many operation in the cleanest FP way.

(operation that benefits from TCO (eg. foldLeft) still need while loops).

## Back to F/Object algebras

No HKT => cannot parametrize carrier type. Solutions:
 - GADT (but no more extensible)
 - Unsafe HKT encoding

For unsafe encoding: see the [Derive4J/HKT project](https://github.com/derive4j/hkt) (provide partial safety)
and application in [Streams à la carte: Extensible Pipelines with Object Algebras](http://biboudis.github.io/papers/streamalg-ecoop15.pdf)

```notes
This may be needed for richer DSL with additional type-safety, or to support dynamic computations (monad).

## Other nice uses of GADT

- single method services:
```java
interface Service {
  <R> IO<R> execute(Command<R> cmd);
}
```

- Almost free (actually initial style) monads (see eg. [eventsrc4j](https://github.com/jbgi/eventsrc4j/)).

# That's all F-olks!

and remember:

<b>"Generics should be the tool of choice for abstracting over types."</b>

_Brian Goetz_

(and "<? super/extends >" makes you lose that game)

```notes
 Hopefully this will give you ideas to level up your Java!

 One last tip: to make maximal use of method reference and type inference in Java:
 never overload any method, in particular avoid static methods with same name as an instance method
 (safest: have all static methods in another class, eg `List` and `Lists` for static methods)
```
---

## And now let's try
this GADT-based service:

```java
interface Speaker {
  <Answer> Option<Answer> ask(Question<Answer> q);
}
```
